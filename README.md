This repository contains projects that I created in APCSP at Jones. 

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project is a game in which the player plays with the computer. In order for the computer to have their selection between

rock, paper, or scissors I have added a randomizer that chooses a number 1-3, and depending on the number, a selection is made. This game

can be played for as many times as the player wants, and if they no longer wish to play, they can end the game.

- Something cool about this piece of code is that it only ends when the player wants to end but also that it keeps score as the

The game keeps on going.

Multiplication Quiz

This project quizzes anyone that plays it, and the player chooses the level they wish to play in the beginning, which depends on 

What they choose, the numbers will vary. This project uses a random function so that the numbers that are displayed are different.

randomized. The multiplication facts will be displayed, and the player will enter their input, and if the answer they entered is wrong, then

it will display incorrect but if it is true it will display correct. At the end the player will know their final score out of the 5 questions that were asked.

-Something unique about this code is that it gives the player the option to choose what level of difficulty they would like to play.

as well as at the end revealing the score of how many name questions they got right out of 5.

Mad Libs

The MadLibs project consists of a random function that randomizes which of the three short story templates will be used but will be customized to the player's liking.

The player will be asked to enter several inputs that go with the prompt asked, for example it will ask for a noun therefore the player would enter a noun. 

After the program has gathered all the input, it will plug it into the short story that was chosen randomly and will be displayed for the player to read.

- A unique part of this project is that the words are entered by the player, so they get to choose what they want to input for the

input that is asked. This project also selects a random MadLib out of three templates.

Simple Calculator 

This program solves any two numbers that are entered by the player in the mood selected. There are 4 modes, which are addition, subtraction,

multiplication and division and this program keeps on going until the player decides they no longer need the calculator and ends 

the program.

- This project offers addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve any numbers that are entered by the player.

Name Generator Game

The name generator program offers various different inputs where the player chooses one of the options, which then leads them to a different option.

till eventually a name will be revealed that will be chosen based on the selections made. This game can be used many times to develop a total of 8 different names.

- The Name Generator project is unique due to the player's ability to choose several options before the final name is revealed.
