# My---Python---Portfolio

This repository contains projects that I created in APCSP at Jones. 

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This project is a game in which the player plays with the computer. In order for the computer to have their selection between
rock, paper, or scissors I have added a randomizer that chooses a number 1-3, and depending on the number, a selection is made. This game
can be played for as many times as the player wants, and if they no longer wish to play, they can end the game.

- Something cool about this piece of code is that it only ends when the player wants to end but also that it keeps score as the
game keeps on going.


Multiplication Quiz

This project quizzes anyone that plays it, and the player chooses the level they wish to play in the beginning, which depending on 
What they choose, the numbers will vary. This project uses a random function so that the numbers that are displayed are different.
randomized. The multiplication facts will be displayed, and the player will enter their input, and if the answer they entered is wrong, then
it will display incorrect but if it is true it will display correct. At the end the player will know their final score out of the 5 questions that were asked.

- Something unique about this code is that it gives the player the option to choose what level of difficulty they would like to play.
as well as at the end revealing the score of how many name questions they got right out of 5.


Mad Libs

The MadLibs project consists of a random function that randomizes which of the three short story templates will be used but will be customized to the player's liking.
The player will be asked to enter several inputs that go with the prompt asked, for example it will ask for a noun therefore the player would enter a noun. 
After the program has gathered all the input, it will plug it into the short story that was chosen randomly and will be displayed for the player to read.

- A unique part of this project is that the words are entered by the player, so they get to choose what they want to input for the
input that is asked. This project also selects a random MadLib out of three templates.


Simple Calculator 

This program solves any two numbers that are entered by the player in the mood selected. There are 4 modes, which are addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division and this program keeps on going until the player decides they no longer need the calculator and ends 
the program.

- This project offers addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve any numbers that are entered by the player.


Name Generator Game

The name generator program offers various different inputs where the player chooses one of the options, which then leads them to a different option.
till eventually a name will be revealed that will be chosen based on the selections made. This game can be used many times to develop a total of 8 different names.

- The Name Generator project is unique due to the player's ability to choose several options before the final name is revealed.

Dog Breeds

This program offers several different functions that each intend to output based on the user input. These individual functions sort through one main list and whatever 
dog breed that matches the specifics entered will be sent to a filtered list and at the end based on what function you are using is what will be displayed. This program is very
customizable and is meant to accommodate several different users.

- Some key features are that this program filters through data based on the users input
- Variety of different data that matches each dog breed

Slot Machine

This program is designed to gamble and there are different odds that bring up the value a person can win depending on what they got is how much money they can win. There are
different odds of getting matching symbols, especially getting all 7's and winning the jackpot.

- This program is unique because since I used random choices then it is very unlikely to get all 7's but it is more likely to get two matching symbols
while the player still wins money.

Magic 8 Ball

In this program the user inputs a question and using the random choice function then output of several answers stored in a list that range from yes to no ones will be chosen at random
and will respond to the user's question.

- This program is unique because there is a variety of responses available and this program evaluates if the input is a question because if it is not there the statesmen will not
be evaluated. The user would have to re enter the statement as a question.

Tetris

This program analyzes the top 100 scores in the history of tetris and there are several functions built into this program to analyze these 100 scores. This program can determine what is the biggest
score and what is the smallest score, aside from this if the user scores a high score they can check if it beats the top scores and if it does it will be appended into the list.
- Hey features are that it sorts through a list and is able to identify the biggest and smallest number
- Another one would be the ability to append new high scores and remove the previous names so that it is only top 100 scores.

Image Recommendor

This program has 5 U.S cities which are Chicago, New York, Los Angeles , Seattle , and Colorado Springs. At random this program will select one of these 5 cities and give a brief description
of the city which is meant to help the user decide which city they want to go to.
- Something unique is that along with the brief description there will also be a picture added to show the city that got chosen. The chosen city is also chosen at random.

Pokemon

This program trains Eevee which is a pokemon character and every day as it gets older and is training more it evolves into an older version of the pokemon. The pokemon can also do battles and if they win they
can go up a couple more levels which hepes the pokemon evolve quicker.
- Key Features are that the pokemon can grow and evolve in different ways and each time we check what there will be a picture displayed of the appearance of the pokemon.

US States

This program uses the 50 states as data to be used in different functions to identify different aspects of a state. Those aspects are a state's capital,a capital's quiz , the year it was founded and a state's nickname.
There are several lists that each are used to help those functions function correctly;try according to what state a user has chosen.
- Something unique about this program is that the capitals quiz has three levels of difficulty and the user can choose which level they want. Helps improve the userâ€™s capacity to know state capitals.
